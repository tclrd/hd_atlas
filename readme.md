Replaces the default GTA V map with an HD Atlas Map.

Re-packed [omgugly's repo of all the maps](https://github.com/omgugly/dlk_maps_fivem) into a single repository to easily be cloned and added to a server.

## Credit

All credit goes to [DieLikeKane](https://aothsa.com/2021/08/08/dlk-hd-atlas-map-for-fivem/) for the map.

Special thanks to [DementedDude](https://forum.cfx.re/u/dementeddude) and [VirusCity](https://forum.cfx.re/u/virus_city/) for the original lua client code to make it work.


## Installation

Download and drag into `/resources` folder or clone the repository.

Add the following to your `server.cfg` file:

```
start hd_atlas
```
